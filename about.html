                <h2>Field Officer Houck: </h2>
                <p>
                    Little is known about this man’s beginning. Agent Houck has been with the LDA from its birth and has since taken the metal detecting stage by storm. He has planned and fought in multiple successful missions to include Operations Heavy Metal and Snow. His detecting prowess and years of experience makes him a formidable force upon any detecting field and has thus allowed him to continue the LDA’s acclaimed war on Security and rival detectorist groups.

                <h2>Field Officer Brad: </h2>
                <p>
                    As a young boy, Sloppy Toppy Brad could not tell the difference between a metal detector and his small wang. In his tribe of 47, Brad lived a painstaking life in which he hunted and scavenged for every meal. But his simpleton ways in the deep forests of Pennsylvania could not contain his grand aspirations. One day, through a mission (Operation Manifest Detectstiny) conducted by the LDA to reach out to promising natives, Brad was enlightened and granted the opportunity to serve within the ranks of the LDA. After being transformed from an uneducated savage to a gentleman detectorist, Brad (Code Name: Shovel Boy) quickly grew to one of the LDA’s highest ranking Field Agents, and to this day, he enjoys all the pleasures such a life can offer.
