            <p class = "p">
                The fine art of metal detecting dates back to the early 19th century. The first metal detector was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1881, who used it to locate a bullet in the chest of U.S. President James Garfield. Interestingly enough, LDA agents still use metal detectors for that same purpose today! However, it was not until the 1920s that the first practical metal detectors were developed for use in the mining industry.

                During the Second World War, metal detectors were widely used for military purposes, such as locating landmines and unexploded bombs – another use carried forward by the LDA. After the war, surplus metal detectors were sold to the public, and treasure hunters began using them to search for buried relics and artifacts. The LDA, while also enjoying the simple pleasantries of relics and artifacts, seek to discover finds that push the borders on current metal detecting laws, societal norms, and morality.

                <br>
                While the LDA was established 1636, metal detecting became a popular hobby to the common public by the 1970s, and various metal detector manufacturers emerged, producing detectors for hobbyists. In the United States, the habit of detecting was popularized by the LDA newsletter which is sent out monthly and includes important and significant information every current and aspiring Agent needs to know. It allows the Agents to keep up to date on the progressions of the organization and recent achievements made nationwide.

                The use of metal detectors for archaeological purposes began in the 1950s, with the development of more sophisticated instruments, for the most sophisticated detectorist, that could accurately detect buried metal objects without damaging them. Today, metal detecting is a widely used tool in archaeology, and is used to locate and document artifacts and other objects of historical interest.

                <br>
                While metal detecting is a popular hobby and a valuable tool for archaeologists, it is important to note that some countries and regions have laws and regulations governing the use of metal detectors. Many will unceasingly adhere to these laws as they are unwilling or unable to sacrifice for something greater than themselves, but an LDA Agent always has a say in where the line is drawn between unlawful and fair-game detecting.
